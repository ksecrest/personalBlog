							<p>Law School with Kids</p>

                            <!-- <p>Rash decisions are not necessarily wrong decisions.  No doubt, law school was a good match for my temperament and talents.  So my decision to go was likely the right decision, but I often wonder at the rashness of my approach.   Okay, today I shudder at the rashness of my approach.  It recalls to life some of those painful moments when the socratic method revealed that I was not at all prepared for class.  As painful as law school was at times, I do wish sometimes I could go back and do better, even if just to prove to myself that I’m not an idiot.  
                                
                                I went to law school with two children — a two year old and a 3 month old infant.   I wasn’t good at juggling the two kids before I started school, let alone once it started  My husband was entering his Phd program and he wasn’t good at it either.  We were these two incredibly incompetent, even clownish parents, trying to do way more than is logical, given our skill set.  
                                
                                I truly tried to put my kids first most of the time, but sometimes I was really just didn’t want to let go of the control.  For instance, instead of getting a babysitter, I attended orientation with my 3 month old infant strapped to my chest.  I remember not getting very much out of the orientation when it was probably an invaluable time to talk to professors and new classmates.  
                                
                                I didn’t like asking for help, and I paid for it.  I remember barely turning in legal writing assignments and almost failing the blue book exam as a 1L because I remember trying to juggle the babies as I approached the final deadlines.  
                                
                                So there it was, I’m not sure how I got through those 3 years.  I had another baby after 2nd year, and so I never actually applied for any summer employment.  I didn’t think that there was any way I could do it, and I know I couldn’t have without help.  
                                
                                I took the Pennsylvania Bar Exam the July after law school and I passed just fine.  I guess I learned more than I thought.  I did learn a lot more than just law though.  I’ll never approach something as serious as that like that again.  I’ll get help.  I’ll figure things out and plan ahead of time.  I realize that you can’t fake or wing it through most serious endeavors.  </p> -->

                                I started law school with a 2 year old and 3 month old baby.  My husband had just finished his 2nd year of medical school and was beginning the Phd part of his education.  It was a ludicrous scheme.  We were new, even clownish parents, and we didn't have a family network of support in the state.  But we moved forward with faith, that somehow it would all work out.  Pitt Law allowed me to do a "Flex-time" schedule.  That meant I crammed all my 1L classes from 8 to 12.  I did torts with one section, criminal law with another, etc.  It was hard and allowed no dedicated study time, but it was a way forward.
                            </p>

                                Would I do it that way if I could do it again?  Absolutely NOT!  I would find a good babysitter and take out the necessary loans to pay for one.  I'd ask my husband to share more of the childcare.  I'd ask family to fly in during finals.  I'd prepare the entire summer before law school.
                            </p>

                                Having said that, I've had to reconcile with myself -- my husband and I were young parents in our 20's.  We tried, even doing the best that we could do.  We didn't understand things as well as we do now.  In the end, we ended up with degrees.  We learned from our mistakes.
