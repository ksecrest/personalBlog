								Yesterday we had our orientation for the Master’s in Software Development program (MSD) at the University of Utah.  As a background, I’m not technically oriented.  I wanted to write about this experience because if I can get through this and change careers, I know that anyone can.  I also have six children, and this will be hard for me.
								
								The MSD at the University of Utah is a 16-month program developed for those interested in software development that do not have previous education or advanced experience in software development. 
								
								Here’s how the orientation played out: 
								
								There was a short breakfast at 8:30am.   It was hard to find a seat because I was my standard 10 minutes late.  At the table with one remaining seat were students doing various degrees:  a PhD in data visualization, a master’s in computer science, and the four of remaining students were in the MSD with me.  
								
								The students doing the PhD and computer science masters had prior computer degrees, but the MSD students had diverse backgrounds.  So far, the degrees from students I talked to are electrical engineering, finance, operations (business), history, Spanish, film, teaching (secondary), finance(business), and art.  Most of the students were approachable.
								
								At orientation, a career coach from the department gave us some general guidance.  She encouraged us to network and go to everything they sponsor – career fairs, meetups, alumni meet and greets, etc.  Then, a few of the professors spoke about the program and got some of us a bit anxious.    Then they passed out new MacBook Airs.
								
								Then there was a student panel with the existing MSD class.  The panel had several different perspectives:  a more chilled out student that studied 1-3 hours per day, two students that studied about 8 hours per day, and a young mother that took care of her toddler after class and didn’t begin studying until about 8 pm at night, when she would study until 2 or 3 in the morning.  The two students that studied 8 hours daily reminded me of several of the students in my 1L law school class (the important first year of law school).   With that memory, I started experiencing hot flashes and feelings of extreme desperation.  I held it in and went up to chat with the relaxed dude after class.
								
								I’m so glad I did.  This laid-back guy was at once comforting.  He said he didn’t really understand the 8 hours.  He thought maybe some of those students socialized and got on Facebook during some of those 8 hours.  He said that he had barely gotten into the program – had to go through 2 cycles on the wait list and had had a 2.8 GPA from college, so he wasn’t a perfect student.
								
								He also clarified something that I loved to hear.  I noticed and remarked that one of the students that studied those 8 hours had a 4.0 and how did he do in a less direct way.   He said, “Well, I ended up with a 3.875 because I forgot about studying for the final exam and basically failed it.  Every time I thought I would fail something, my grade got curved up tremendously and I got all A’s except for the D that became a B.  That B was my only B.”
								
								That conversation made my day.  It was a little hope that would at least shackle my anxiety until class begins on Monday.
