							<p>Out of laziness, I often call myself a vegan. But, I'm not. I try to follow a whole food plant-based diet. 
								Veganism is a diet concerned with avoiding dairy, beef, poultry, fish, pork, and fish to avoid cruelty to animals.  
								Vegans generally do not use animal products like honey or gelatin or wear or buy items made out of leather. 
								Vegans and whole food plant-based are not necessarily the same because vegans might eat many sugary foods like Oreos, fried foods, or processed foods. 
								Eating a whole food plant-based diet means avoiding any animal foods, including seafood, 
								dairy, and eggs and any processed foods, oils, store-processed fake meats, sugar, etc. </p>
							<p>Truly, my conscience is more at peace these days about animals in general. 
								However, avoiding animal cruelty was not the reason I initially stopped consuming meat or dairy. 
								It had to do with health. For more than a decade, I've felt that the right way to eat does not include meat or dairy,
								but I didn't know why I felt this way. My Mother sent me the book, The China Study, at the right moment in my life.
								I learned about research that supports NOT eating meat or dairy WHILE eating lots of whole fruits, vegetables, and grains. 
								It aligns with the Word of Wisdom, which is a section within a religious text of my faith.</p>
							<strong>How did you transition to this way of eating?
							</strong>
							<p>It has been a process that didn’t begin with “The China Study.”</p>
							<p>Back in about 2008, I'd met a family that did organic farming. 
								My friend told me to read “Omnivore's Dilemma”. 
								As a result of reading that book, I learned to cook! 
								I could make anything from scratch after a few years.</p>
							<p> </p>
							<p>We cut out added sugars in 2016 after watching "That Sugar Film". 
								That documentary helped me to realize how much sugar is in yogurt, granola bars, and even “healthy” breakfast cereals. 
								That transition was the most difficult for our entire family because sugar is in everything. 
								Also, some people think that you are the devil if you don't let them give your kids sugar. 
								They will say okay, but utter mean things under their breath about it. </p>
							<p>In about 2018, my kids that were 10 and 12 told me that they wanted to become vegetarian. 
								My 14 yr-old son had already been a vegetarian from the age of 9. 
								The kids told me that it wasn't fair that they he could be a vegetarian and they couldn't. 
								I agreed, and within a few months I was a vegetarian too. </p>
							<p>In 2019, I read “The China Study,” and I was instantly converted. 
								For my birthday, my husband asked me what I wanted  and I asked him to read it. 
								He did it because he loves me and he's awesome. 
								Within another few weeks he was trying to adopt the WFPB diet as well.</p>
							<p>Although that was the official time of the beginning of our transition, we still went slow. 
								I didn't throw away the butter in my freezer for example, but rather gradually used it up while transitioning over to the WFPB diet. 
								I used oil in cooking for another year or so, albeit more and more sparingly. I have learned to use very little oil.  
								I took the Forks Over Knives Ultimate Cooking Class that is hosted through Rouxbe. Even though it was online, it was good. 
								They have a section in the course about learning to cook without oil using the Lichtenstein effect. I loved that lesson.
							</p>
							<p>I wanted to write these transitions down, so that others can see how we have done things so far and how gradually we have done this.   
								This is not a diet at all, but a journey to better health that takes small consistent steps in the right direction. </p>
