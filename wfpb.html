							<p>Out of laziness, I often call myself a vegan.  But, I actually try to follow a whole food plant-based diet.  The fact that I “try” means that I still have progress to make.  I’m not a vegan in the traditional sense.  Veganism used to be diet concerned with avoiding dairy, beef, poultry, fish, pork, or fish to avoid cruelty to animals, but now it has evolved to include those that do not use animal-based products for whatever reason.  Vegans generally do not use animal products like honey or gelatin or wear or buy items made out of leather or other animal skins. </p>
							<p>Truly, my conscience is more at peace these days about animals in general.  However, avoiding animal cruelty was not the reason I stopped consuming meat or dairy.  It had completely to do with health.  For more than a decade, I've felt that the right way does not include meat or dairy, but I didn't know why I felt this way.  I stumbled upon the right book - The China Study - at the right moment in my life.  I learned about research that supports NOT eating meat or dairy WHILE eating lots of whole fruits, vegetables, and grains.  It aligns with the Word of Wisdom, which is a section within a religious text of my faith.  At this point, I adopted a whole-food-plant-based lifestyle. </p>
							<bold>But I didn't go cold turkey.</bold>
							<p>Back in about 2008, I'd met a family that did organic farming.  My friend told me to read Omniovore's Dilemena.  As a result of reading that book, I learned to cook!  I could make anything after a few years -- I remember during a blizzard making mayonnaise and ketchup.  I learned how to make everything from scratch. </p>
							<p>We cut out added sugars in 2016 after watching "That Sugar Film".  That was a huge change for us because he didn't eat a ton of sweets, but that movie helped me to realize how much sugar is in yogurt, granola bars, and even healthy seeming breakfast cereals.  That transition was the most difficult for our entire family because sugar is in everything. Also, everyone things you are the devil if you don't let them give your kids sugar.  They will say okay, but utter mean things under their breath about it. </p>
							<p>In about 2018, my kids that were 10 and 12 told me that they wanted to become vegetarian.  My 14 yr-old son had already been a vegetarian since he was 9.  They told that it wasn't fair that they he could be a vegetarian and they couldn't.  I agreed, and within a few months I was a vegetarian too. </p>
							<p>In 2019, I read the China Study, and I was instantly converted.  For my birthday, my husband asked me what I wanted and I said, "For you to read The China Study".  He did because he loves me and he's awesome.   Within another few weeks he was trying to adopt the WFPB diet as well.</p>
							<p>Although that the official time of the beginning of our transition, we still went slow.  I didn't throw away the butter in my freezer for examply, but rather gradually used it up while transitioning over to the WFPB diet.  I used oil in cooking for another year or so, albeit more and more sparingly and I still use spray oil for some baking/cooking.  I have mostly learned to not use oil at all.  I took the Forks Over Knives Ultimate Cooking Class that is hosted through Rouxbe.  Even though it was online, it was really good.  They have a section in the course about learning to cook without oil using the lichtenstein effect.  I loved that lesson.</p>
							<p>I wanted to write these transitions down, so that others can see how we have done things so far and how gradually we have done this.   This is the type of thing that is not a diet at all, but a journey to better health that takes small consistent steps in the right direction. </p>
