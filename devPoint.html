                            <p>
                                In January of 2021, I enrolled in a simple IT class at the local community college, Davis Tech.  It provided a good overview, and I took the CompTIA(ITF+)certification at the end of it. After this I asked one of the teachers if I could skip through the hardware stuff and take a programming class and they let me take the first programming basics class, which was taught with Visual Studio; we learned Visual Basic. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I learned a lot with that first coding class, but I could tell that it was outdated.  I talked to the guys over at Dev Point Labs, which do a 3 month coding boot camp.  I opted for the part-time program which held class from 6-9 Mon-Thurs.  I ultimately learned ruby as the backend; javascript as the frontend.  Although, we learned gradually to some degree, using ruby on rails at first, with only a bit of javascript.
                            </p>

                            <strong>
                                What did I learn?
                            </strong>

                            <p>
                                I learned that I have a lot to learn about coding.  This bootcamp was a good intro, but that I in no way was prepared to enter the workforce as any type of coder.
                            </p>

                            <strong>
                                Were other students prepared?
                            </strong>

                            <p>
                                Maybe.  Probably.  I was one of 5 in my cohort.  We all came from different backgrounds - an English professor, me (a non-practicing attorney), a computer science student with a couple of years of relevant schooling, a new computer science student that had just changed majors, and a Costco employee.  The computer science student that was well into his program was the most confident after the program. 
                            </p>

                            <strong>Was the instruction lacking?</strong>
                            <p>
                                Not at all!  I just think that 3 months in a part-time program is not enough time for most people of normal intelligence to absorb the material!
                            </p>
