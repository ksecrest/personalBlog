							<strong> The Utah UBE </strong>

                            <!-- <p>Rash decisions are not necessarily wrong decisions.  No doubt, law school was a good match for my temperament and talents.  So my decision to go was likely the right decision, but I often wonder at the rashness of my approach.   Okay, today I shudder at the rashness of my approach.  It recalls to life some of those painful moments when the socratic method revealed that I was not at all prepared for class.  As painful as law school was at times, I do wish sometimes I could go back and do better, even if just to prove to myself that I’m not an idiot.  
                                
                                I went to law school with two children — a two year old and a 3 month old infant.   I wasn’t good at juggling the two kids before I started school, let alone once it started  My husband was entering his Phd program and he wasn’t good at it either.  We were these two incredibly incompetent, even clownish parents, trying to do way more than is logical, given our skill set.  
                                
                                I truly tried to put my kids first most of the time, but sometimes I was really just didn’t want to let go of the control.  For instance, instead of getting a babysitter, I attended orientation with my 3 month old infant strapped to my chest.  I remember not getting very much out of the orientation when it was probably an invaluable time to talk to professors and new classmates.  
                                
                                I didn’t like asking for help, and I paid for it.  I remember barely turning in legal writing assignments and almost failing the blue book exam as a 1L because I remember trying to juggle the babies as I approached the final deadlines.  
                                
                                So there it was, I’m not sure how I got through those 3 years.  I had another baby after 2nd year, and so I never actually applied for any summer employment.  I didn’t think that there was any way I could do it, and I know I couldn’t have without help.  
                                
                                I took the Pennsylvania Bar Exam the July after law school and I passed just fine.  I guess I learned more than I thought.  I did learn a lot more than just law though.  I’ll never approach something as serious as that like that again.  I’ll get help.  I’ll figure things out and plan ahead of time.  I realize that you can’t fake or wing it through most serious endeavors.  </p> -->

                                In 2016, my husband finished his residency and my big brother moved with his family to Utah.  He was a successful Texas attorney.  I hadn't taken the Utah bar yet and he encouraged me to take it.  (I've always had a Pennsylvania license, but couldn't fulfill the practice requirment to get reciprocity.)
                            <p>
								In 2018, I signed up, studied and took the Utah bar.  And passed!  It was a major deal to learn all the law again 10 years later when I hadn't even been practicing!
                            </p>	
                            
                            <strong>
								How did I do I study for it?  

							</strong>

							<p>
								
								I studied for 1-2 hours a day for about 3 months and ramped up studying the last 2 months like a regular law school student would have.  I have 6 kids and my twins were only in half day kindergarten, so I studied less daily, but for a longer period of time.  
							</p>

							<strong> 
								Which bar prep did I use?
							</strong>

							<p>
								I didn't use Barbri or anything very expensive this time around.  I used Barbri the first time.  I used Barmax for the UBE, which is self-paced and online.  It was well-organized and I would recommend it even for a first-time taker.  I think i did every UBE question they had twice!  I did lots of timed essay practice and sent in at least one of my writing practice tests for feedback.
							</p>

							<p>
								For my first bar-exam I initally signed up the live Barbri lecture program.  However, after the first week, I transferred to the recorded version.  I did this because being in those live sessions with the students from my law school, especially the really succesful students, intimidated me and made me feel really nervous.  There was so much tension in the air.  In the recorded lectures, it was an evening course so some of the students were working already and it was far less intidmidating. 
							</p>

							<strong> How did the state specific Pennsylvania bar exam differ from the UBE?
							</strong>


							<p>
								Not very much at all.  I struggled on exactly the same areas, although I did better on the 2nd bar exam.  There was very little state specific law on the Pennsyvlania exam that differed from the black letter law.  In my opinion, there is little benefit to worrying about the state specific law for the PA exam.
							</p>

							<strong>
								My weakness on the bar exam
							</strong>

							<p>
								My weakness have been the same since I was in the 5th grade.  I do not synthesize and write as quickly as I need to for the essay sections of the bar exam.  I'm a slow and thoughtful writer, especially when I'm anxious.  I practiced the writing sections a lot the second time around, but this is still not a strength.
